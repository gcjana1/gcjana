               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Brain Computer Interface technology enables a pathway for analyzing EEG signals for
seizure detection. EEG signal decomposition, features extraction and machine learning techniques are
more familiar in seizure detection. However, selecting decomposition technique and concatenation of
their features for seizure detection is still in the state-of-the-art phase. This work proposes DWT-EMD
Feature level Fusion-based seizure detection approach over multi and single channel EEG signals
and studied the usability of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition
(EMD) feature fusion with respect to individual DWT and EMD features over classifiers SVM, SVM
with RBF kernel, decision tree and bagging classifier for seizure detection. All classifiers achieved an
improved performance over DWT-EMD feature level fusion for two benchmark seizure detection
EEG datasets. Detailed quantification results have been mentioned in the Results section

               <h5><i>Article</i>: Capsule neural networks on spatio-temporal EEG frames for cross-subject emotion recognition</h5>
               <p>
			   Scalp EEG plots are plots of scalp potentials against time, and hence, capture spatial information, owing to the placement of electrodes on the scalp, as well as, temporal information from variations in brain waves. In this
paper we propose a novel method to make a combined representation of spatial and temporal information, by incorporating the signals into a sparse spatio-temporal frame, such that it can be easily processed by deep
learning algorithms in the computer vision domain. Familiarities of a model to the test data in the setting of emotion recognition from EEG, is also defined, and a form of data splitting such that the model has to perform on
a set with which it has the minimum degree of familiarity is introduced. A CapsNet architecture is trained on DEAP dataset to perform on a cross-subject binary classification task, and tuning of the hyperparameters using
Bayesian Optimization is analyzed. The proposed model reports a best-case accuracy of 0.85396 and average case accuracy of 0.57165 for LOO subject, and a best case of 1.0 and average case of 0.51071 for unseen-subjectunseen-record classification, when averaged across all the classes (i.e., valence, dominance, arousal, and
liking), which is comparable to that reported by other works. <b><i>Article Link</i><b>:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103361" target="_blank"><b> DOI</b></a>
