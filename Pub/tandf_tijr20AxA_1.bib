    abstract = { Seizures are the part of the epilepsy that occurs in central nervous system which leads abnormal brain activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recordings are mostly used in epileptic seizure detection process. Detection of seizures is a crucial part for further treatment of patients. This paper proposes a multi-view SVM model for seizure detection using the single channel EEG signals. In this experiment, two views of the EEG data have been extracted, (1) the time domain features using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and (2) power spectral densities are obtained in the frequency domain. Extracted features have been fed to multi-view SVM classification model. In this study, a single channel EEG dataset is used for seizure detection. Performance estimation parameters namely Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, and AUC value have been estimated for evaluating the proposed model. The model classified seizure and non-seizure over the sets A vs E and B vs E with an accuracy greater than 99\% using k-fold cross validation. The classification accuracy obtained by multi-view SVM is better by 1â€“4\% than single view SVM using the same features. Furthermore, the proposed model is also compared with existing single view SVM models. It is observed that the multi view SVM model performed significantly better, compare to a single view SVM model over the same features. }
