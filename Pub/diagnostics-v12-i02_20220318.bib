ABSTRACT = {Brain Computer Interface technology enables a pathway for analyzing EEG signals for seizure detection. EEG signal decomposition, features extraction and machine learning techniques are more familiar in seizure detection. However, selecting decomposition technique and concatenation of their features for seizure detection is still in the state-of-the-art phase. This work proposes DWT-EMD Feature level Fusion-based seizure detection approach over multi and single channel EEG signals and studied the usability of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) feature fusion with respect to individual DWT and EMD features over classifiers SVM, SVM with RBF kernel, decision tree and bagging classifier for seizure detection. All classifiers achieved an improved performance over DWT-EMD feature level fusion for two benchmark seizure detection EEG datasets. Detailed quantification results have been mentioned in the Results section.},
